        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Selena Raygoza. I am a currently an undergrad student at the University of California-Riverside. I am a first gen student and come from a family of immigrants who have work hard to allow me to pursue a greater education and not have to worry about going straight into the work force. I am majoring in Creative writing with an emphasis on non-fiction. Starting in the fall I will be beginning my last year in completing my bachelorâ€™s degree. Once I graduate, I will be the first in my family to make it through to have a degree. I plan to be continuing my education and to receive my masterâ€™s in creative writing. I have begun to look into different programs to apply to and rough drafts of chapters for my portfolio. In the winter of my senior year I will begin to write my senior thesis while working alongside a full-time professor at the university. A lot of my writing whether it is poetry, fiction, or non-fiction has been inspired by many of the experiences my family has struggled through. Mixing this in with common culture practices in my latinx community I plan to write my senior thesis on how this has affected my generation. 
	While working on my non-fiction thesis I have been trying out the different genres offered at the university. This spring quarter I have been focusing on the poetry genre. I found that trying out different genres has helped me to expand on my ideas for a future book of essays or novel. Now with more time to focus on my writing I will be looking into different magazines or anthologies to work on sharing my work and getting published. Doing so will also get me experience with rejection that many deal with in the writing community. 
While I dream of publishing many of my own novels, I will work on trying to work in publishing. In the many workshop classes I have taken in my undergrad I discovered that I enjoy reading other peopleâ€™s work and sharing feedback. This will be a more secure form of income while I continue to work on the writing I have been working hard on since my freshmen year. I began originally majoring in English because I was told it was safer than creative writing. I found while I enjoyed reading different authors, I couldnâ€™t find enjoyment in simply analyzing others work. I realized that I didnâ€™t need to make millions as long as I am working in something I really enjoyed. 
I will also begin to look into how I could work my way towards teaching creative writing. I would prefer to teach at a college level to students who desire to practice their art and express themselves. I hope to one day inspire the future generations the way that I have been inspired by many professors I have had the honor of working with in my undergraduate years.
